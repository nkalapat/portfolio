    <p style = "background-color: #ffbd87;">My name is Nikhila Kalapatapu and I am a high school senior from San Jose, California. I was born in the Bay Area and have been surrounded by technology all my life. This summer, I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Pivotal, a software company in Palo Alto. I learned how to code exciting projects using Scratch, HTML and CSS, Python, and Javascript. One of my favorite projects was a "decision game" that I made, with a partner, using Python. Participating in the Summer Immersion Program also allowed me to hear from various employees at Pivotal and members of the tech industry. Check out some of my projects below! </p>
