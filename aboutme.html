    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nikhila and I am a high school senior from San Jose, California. Some of my hobbies are: traveling, reading, playing with my dog, eating good food, and watching Netflix. My favorite foods to eat are coffee ice cream and Chinese takeout. Out of all of the countries that I have visited, Denmark is my favorite. In the future, I hope to travel to every single continent in the world. I like living in California because I do not like being too cold or too hot.</p>
