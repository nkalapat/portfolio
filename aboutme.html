    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nikhila and I am a high school senior from San Jose, California. I was born in the Bay Area and have lived in it all my life. Some of my hobbies are: traveling, listening to music, reading, playing with my dog, eating good food, and watching Netflix. My favorite flavor of ice cream is coffee. Out of all of the countries that I have visited, Denmark is my favorite. In the future, I hope to travel to every single continent at least once. I love living in California because I enjoy spending time outdoors in the great weather. My favorite genre of music is rap and some of my favorite artists are Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean, and Beyonce. When I have free time, I enjoying watching TV shows. Some of my favorite are Grey's Anatomy, Criminal Minds, and New Girl. I am terrible at cooking but love to watch cooking competitions, like Chopped, on TV. My favorite holidays are Halloween and Christmas.</p>
