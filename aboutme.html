    <p style = "background-color: #ffbd87;">My name is Nikhila and I am a high school senior from San Jose, California. I was born in the Bay Area and have been surrounded by technology all my life. This summer, I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Pivotal, a software company in Palo Alto. I learned how to code exciting projects using Scratch, HTML and CSS, Python, and Javascript. </p>
