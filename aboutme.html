    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nikhila and I am a high school senior from San Jose, California. I was born in the Bay Area and have lived here all my life. Some of my hobbies are: traveling, listening to music, reading, playing with my dog, eating good food, and watching Netflix. My favorite foods to eat are coffee ice cream and Chinese takeout. If I coudl only drink three beverages for the rest of my life, I would choose Dr. Pepper, Philz Mint Mojitos, and orange juice. I do not like pizza, white chocolate, and cherry flavored popiscles or candy. Out of all of the countries that I have visited, Denmark is my favorite. In the future, I hope to travel to every single continent. However, I like living in California because I do not like being too cold or too hot. My favorite genre of music is rap and some of my favorite artists are Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean, and Beyonce. When I have free time, I enjoying watching TV shows on Netflix. Some of my favorite are Grey's Anatomy, Criminal Minds, and How to Get Away with Murder. I am terrible at cooking but love to watch cooking competitions, like Chopped, on TV.</p>
