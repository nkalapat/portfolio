<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Nikhila and I am a high school senior from San Jose, California. Some of my hobbies are: traveling, reading, playing with my dog, eating good food, and watching Netflix. My favorite flavor of ice cream is coffee and my favorite cuisine is Chinese. In the near future, I hope to travel to and study abroad in southeast Asia or sub-Saharan Africa. Although I love all animals, I am most fascinated by tigers and alligators. After college, I plan to attend medical school.</p>
